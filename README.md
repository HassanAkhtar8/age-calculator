## Overview
- The Age Calculator program takes the date of birth from three input fields (year, month, and day) and calculates the age in years, months, and days. It provides an easy way to determine precise age by considering the current date and accounting for factors like leap years and varying month lengths. The calculated age is displayed in a user-friendly format, aiding applications such as age verification and assessments.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
- Any field is empty when the form is submitted
- The day number is not between 1-31
- The month number is not between 1-12
- The year is in the future
- The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
